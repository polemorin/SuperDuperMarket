Instructions:

1)Run Apache tomcat.

2)Put SDMWeb3.1_war.war file in the webapps folder (where you have apache tomcat installed).

3)Open chrome and go to:    localhost:8080/SDMWeb3.1_war/

4)Enter username and role in the system (1st role should be store owner).

5)If chosen role was Store owner there will be an option to load information into the system, upload either ex3-big.xml or ex3-small.xml.

6)To see all of the apps features it is recommended to log in both as a store owner and as a customer (one of them should be in         incognito mode since the system recognizes multipal log-ins from the same browser as the same user and wont let you log in).
